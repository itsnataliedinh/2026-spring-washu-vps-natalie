        Restaurant websites are not something I expect as a consumer. I’m used to finding images of physical menus on Google Maps listings or Yelp. I’m not even expecting a “good” or visually pleasing physical menu design. I find it common for many hole-in-the-wall or hidden gem restaurants to barely have a designed menu. I agree with the author that restaurants can get away with a “bad” menu design or menu site since restaurants are a very physically based experience. When I think of my favorite restaurant in Chinatown, for example, I’m not surprised by the menu being a typed-up Word document that was printed out. Restaurants that serve food at competitive prices cut margin cost at any expense. However, when a restaurant does have a site that is well designed, I’m always delightfully surprised.

        As a designer, I never considered how digital experiences shape the restaurant industry. I think a well-designed menu site is important for accessibility and dietary restrictions. Many conditions can shape the website experience. Designers can highlight the restaurant’s interior or create customizable experiences for the user. I think customization is essential for food allergies and intolerances.
