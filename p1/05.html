<!-- CHANGES: 
    1) adding collapsible dropdowns to all sections 
        - struggled to make the open/close arrow on same line as text; <h2> tag must force a break.
    2) adding emojis/ icons

        <p><em>Please confirm allergens with the chef! </em></p>


        <details><summary><strong>Korean Cheesey Corn (V✓ + GF✓) </strong></summary>
        <p>A generous portion of this delicious, cheesy, and mouth-watering corn makes a perfect side dish for your meals. This special is gluten-free and vegetarian friendly.</p>
        </details> <br>

        <details> <summary><strong>Kimchi Carbonara (V✓)</strong></summary>
        <p>A generous portion of luscious Korean udon noodles tossed in a white wine, vegan butter, garlic, ginger, shallot and onion sauce, my vegan kimchi, chiffonade spinach, gochugaru pepper, scallions, and parmesan. I will also have vegan parmesan available! I HIGHLY recommend adding your favorite Tiny Chef protein and happy, sunny egg for an upcharge.</p>
        </details> <br>

        <details> <summary><strong>Korean Radish Stew </strong></summary>
        <p>Big chunks of Korean radish, carrots, onions, shallot, potato, mushrooms, garlic and more make this a one-of-a-kind meal. The broth is velvety smooth and features a homemade deonjang paste and gochugaru from the smoky mountains of Gwangju. I highly recommend adding your favorite Tiny Chef protein and a sunny egg to your stew for even more flavor! This delicious bowl of stew will come with a side of rice and gets topped with scallions and toasted sesame seeds.</p>
        </details> <br>

        <details> <summary><strong>Bulgogi Mushroom ((V✓ + GF✓)) </strong></summary>
        <p>A medley of Asian mushroom sautéed with Mirin and my housemade bulgogi sauce. These mushrooms are vegan friendly AND gluten-free. Add these babies to the Bibimbap, Korean Street Tacos, or get them as a side!</p>
        </details> <br>

        <details> <summary><strong>Musubi Burrito (V✓ + GF✓)</strong></summary>
        <p>Your choice of fried spam or tofu, spinach, nanami togurashi, fried egg, your choice of spicy Dragon or sweet 'n savory Pixie sauce, and rice all wrapped in nori. I HIGHLY recommend adding the cheese for an upcharge to take this burrito to a whole new level. I also have vegan cheese available. These are gluten-free and, without the egg, vegan friendly!</p>
        </details> <br>

        <details> <summary><strong>Yukgaejang (V✓ + GF✓)</strong></summary>
        <p>Yukgaejang 육개장 is a spicy Korean soup chock full of ingredients, including Korean root vegetables and Korean sweet potato noodles. But don't worry, I didn't make it very spicy at all!</p> <br>
        <p>Korean gosari (a delicious Korean root vegetable), lotus root, Korean sweet potato, onion, carrot, mung bean sprouts, a wide variety of delicious mushrooms, and more are just a part of this epic stew! It's usually made with beef and beef stock, but since I try and make everything from the start vegan friendly, this version has zero animal products. It's also gluten-free, even with the noodles!</p>
        <p>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND adding protein, a side of rice, and a sunny egg because that will just add to the many levels of flavor. You do not want to miss this special!!</p>
