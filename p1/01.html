<details> <summary><strong>Korean Radish Stew </strong></summary>
<p>Big chunks of Korean radish, carrots, onions, shallot, potato, mushrooms, garlic and more make this a one-of-a-kind meal.

<p>Your choice of fried spam or tofu, spinach, nanami togurashi, fried egg, your choice of spicy Dragon or sweet 'n savory Pixie sauce, and rice all wrapped in nori.

<details> <summary><strong>Yukgaejang +</strong></summary>
<p>Yukgaejang 육개장 is a spicy Korean soup chock full of ingredients, including Korean root vegetables and Korean sweet potato noodles. But don't worry, I didn't make it very spicy at all!</p> <br>
<p>Korean gosari (a delicious Korean root vegetable), lotus root, Korean sweet potato, onion, carrot, mung bean sprouts, a wide variety of delicious mushrooms, and more are just a part of this epic stew! It's usually made with beef and beef stock, but since I try and make everything from the start vegan friendly, this version has zero animal products. It's also gluten-free, even with the noodles!</p>
<p>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND adding protein, a side of rice, and a sunny egg because that will just add to the many levels of flavor. You do not want to miss this special!!</p>
