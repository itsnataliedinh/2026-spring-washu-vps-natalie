    <h3>Response 2: The New Turing Test</h3>
    <p class="date">January 22, 2026</p>
    <p>
        With advancing AI, it has become harder to differentiate what is made with AI and what is authentic. The recent Gemini Nano Banana Pro delivers realistic photos that have advanced significantly since 2022. Instead of harsh contrast, Nano Banana Pro photos display soft, natural lighting that resembles something from an iPhone. The normalized usage of AI-generated images threatens our visual analysis as we consume without questioning. Ullendorff comments on our social media habits of tagging friends or sharing posts through DMs, “It is an image that does not ask for commentary.” We like, click share, all without doubt.

        The author’s commentary on Sports Illustrated highlights how authorship equals accountability. As professional companies and publications rely more on AI, they try to absolve themselves of the faults made by AI. However, AI is a series of algorithms that reflects our learnings from what is present in data and media, capturing the same biases that we have. The data from institutions are often exclusive of BIPOC, queer, low-income, or other disadvantaged communities. A. as an industry is led primarily by white, upper-class individuals who reinforce these systemic biases. I appreciate how Ullendorf suggests that instead of asking “Is this made with A.?”, we instead ask “How much humanity is in this?”

        Ullendorf’s framework to evaluate how authentic a piece of work is to ask:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Does it feel like it came <i>from</i> someone?</li>
        <li>Does it feel like it was meant <i>for</i>someone?</li> 
        <li>Does it belong in a <i>particular</i> context?</li> 
    </ol>
    <p>
        I find the choice of the word “someone” interesting because it implies the work needs to be personalized or intentional for *someone* rather than *anyone*. There needs to be a specific voice, context, or style that separates the work from feeling generic. I find the author’s choice to use the word “feel” to be impactful because she implies there is no 100% right or wrong evidence as to what is authentic. To capture humanity is to rely on a gut feeling, which, like humans, is full of faults.

        A work is only meaningful if it establishes a relationship between the artist or object and the audience. A work of art isn’t about visual beauty, but it is meant to question, disrupt, or reflect the audience’s assumed knowledge.
    </p>

        While I have experimented with AI images in Midjourney or Adobe, I still question whether AI should be in my design practice. AI trains on images made by artists and everyday people, often without consent. There are also the environmental impacts of AI that make me wonder if AI artists should exist. There certainly are AI artist out there who make cool AI art within a specific style that reflects their own practice. Most importantly, how do they reckon the moral and environmental impacts of making AI art?
