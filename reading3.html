    <h3>Response 3: Cyborgs vs Rooms</h3>
    <p class="date">January 29, 2026</p>
    <p>
        I find the author's definition of "cyborgs" and "rooms" to be interesting ways to categorize how we interact with technology. While advancing tech advertises AI, such as those of the meta glasses, there is a charm to said "rooms." The use of living room speakers or light installations in interactive museums engage not only our individual bodies but all the people within a space, creating a sense of dynamism. Personally, I think the younger generation has become highly adept at technology and exhuasted of it. So, the return to more "analog" or room-based tech that involves a group of people is appealing.

        Dynamicland's case is interesting since they argue a room can become a computer even without technology. This reminds me of conditional design, and how a set of rules is like an alogorithm. In this metaphor, anything can function as an opportunity for "computer-like" interaction from a board-game to a series of rule-based sequences. I'll reference the conditional design website below!
